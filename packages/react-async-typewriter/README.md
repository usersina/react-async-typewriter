# React Asynchronous Typewriter

> An asynchronous react typewriter that handles streams

Large Language Models can take quite a bit of time to generate the full response, hence most API services tend to provide streaming endpoints to return the data as soon as it's being generated (time to first token).

This library is a way to get the response stream from a fetch request returning a stream and parse its result.
